# Open Source, Standards Development and Patents in Europe (Mirko Boehm)

* Discussion between how FOSS and legal departments handling ipatents works (or don't do) together
* What comes first implementation or specification. In FOSS implementation comes first than the specification.
* None of us can define a standard since a standard can only be set by a recognized party. De-facto standards...

# Let's Lisp like it's 1959 (Kristoffer Gr&ouml;nlund)

* Quite out there but gave a nice history lesson about LISP and John McCarty
* Simplicity of implementing an interpreter for it
* Modern implementation today is Closure

---

# Understanding user namespaces (Michael Kerrisk)

* seven namespaces in Linux (PID, UTS, network etc.)
* what does it mean to be superuser in a namespace? relations to its parents
* unshare...
* security conserents, new execution paths

# Component-based Design System and Development (Tereza Novotna, David Halasz)

* Red Hat has many web tooling (about 50)
* Typically acquired companies has different look and feel
* Leaving bootstrap since more complex applications are hard to manage. Easy to bootstrap?
* [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/)

# Limiting side-effects of applications at compile-time (Ram&oacute;n Soto Mathiesen)

* Haskell - stateless functional language 
* By separating side effects to special parts (Monads) one can make sure side effects won't happen
* Forcing third party to not have side effect
* Security

# Open Data - the City of Gothenburg (Kim Lantto)

* Gothenburg ranked 2nd Smart City in the world
* [Open data](

# Open Data - Mimbly (Nicolas Maxant)

* [Water-recycling system from washing machine](https://www.mimbly.se/projects)
* Using available data and collected data to take decisions
---

# 17,000 contributions in 32K RAM (Jan Jongboom)

* 31 billion uC shipped 2019 (25 billion in 2015)
* Mbed OS (Real-Time Operating System for uC)
* 400 unique contributors
* Apache 2.0 license
* libraries of functions, HAL API, HAL implementation
![Design](https://os.mbed.com/media/uploads/emilmont/mbed_layers.png)

# Common Voice - Building Multilingual Voice Datasets (Kalyan Dikshit)

* Moz://a is an initiative to make voice recognition open
* Google, Apple, Amazon has its own locked in ones
* To help building the DB join the project
* Needs 1000 hours of a language to be accurate

# Reducing the boot time of Linux devices (Chris Simmonds)

* From 11+ seconds to 2+ seconds
* Changing boot order in Linux, be aware of unloaded resources
* Remove unused drivers in kernel
* Remove countdown in u-boot, remove drivers in u-boot
* Falcon mode!

# Open Source Geolocation: The story & challenges ahead (Zeeshan Ali)

* Getting a position from e.g. a laptop is not easy
* geoIP, GPS, SSID...
* Google know a lot but we don't get access to it all
* Geoclue
* Privacy issues - dont give random application a users location

# Red Hat discussions

* ~200 employees in Sweden and ~10 in Gothenburg
